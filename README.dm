A Rock Paper Scissors game coded in Python as part of the Edinburgh College's course - CodeSpace - Induction CR1CSICZ22-X1XA

I used Replit to create the program and based it my javaScript game rock/paper/scissors that I programmed first. That program can also be found on my github: https://github.com/gurgeasson/rockPaperScissors---JS
